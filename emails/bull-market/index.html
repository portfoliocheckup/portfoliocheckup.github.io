												<p>
													We all know that bull markets come to an end.   So the better question is, are you prepared for a market drop?  What does it mean to be prepared?    One must not only be prepared with the right strategy, but one must also be prepared with the right psychology.
												</p>

												<p>
													While nobody can predict when the bull market will end, or which asset classes will do well when stock prices do fall, history shows that one can only minimize the damage through one thing:
												</p>
												<h2 style="text-align: center;">Asset Allocation!</h2>
												<p>
													Most people do not have an asset allocation that suits their risk tolerance, their time horizon, or their general financial outcomes.   Nor do they have a system in place to rebalance the funds that have done well with the funds that have not.   Most folks typically own a bunch of mutual funds and “hope” they do well over time.  Hope is not a strategy. 
												</p>
												<p>
													<span class="stand_out">Decisions, Decisions.</span>  Studies show that most investors make the wrong decision (read emotional decision) at the wrong time.  They sell at the bottom and buy at the top.   They chase performance and buy 5 star mutual funds.   One study was done which studied the ten-year subsequent performance of those who bought five-star funds. What did they find? <span class="italics">“Of the 248 mutual stock funds with five-star ratings at the start of the period, just 4 still kept that rank after 10 years.”</span>
												</p>
												<p class="italics">
													Summary:  One must be sure that they have the right asset allocation for their personal desired outcome that has a focus both on low fees and tax efficiency.  They also need to have a system and/or advisor that will help guard against making emotional decisions at the wrong time.
